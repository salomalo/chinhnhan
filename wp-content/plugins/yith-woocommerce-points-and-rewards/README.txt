YITH WooCommerce Points and Rewards allows you to start a rewarding program in your site and encourage your customers to collect points.

== Description ==

Have you ever started collecting shopping points? What was your reaction? Most of us are really motivated in storing as many points as possible, because we can get more this way, and often we do not care about spending more because, if we do, we can have a better reward. Hasn't this happened to you too? That's what you get by putting into your WooCommerce site a point and reward programme: loyalising your customers, encouraging them to buy always from your shop and being rewarded for their loyalty. If you think that reward programmes were only prerogative of big shopping centres or supermarkets, you have to change your mind, because now with YITH WooCommerce Points and Rewards you can allow your customers to collect points each time they purchase an item in your WooCommerce-based shop. Then, you can have a clear overview about points collected by them in your backend and choose to reward them. A powerful tool that extends WooCommerce standard behaviour, where no point collection is available.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YIThemes, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days. 

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!

= How can I get more features for my WooCommerce plugin? =
You can get more features with the premium version of YITH WooCommerce Points and Rewards, available on [YIThemes page](https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-points-and-rewards). Here you can read more about the premium features of the plugin and make it give it its best shot!


= How can I try the full-featured plugin? =

If you want to see a demonstration version of the premium version of YITH WooCommerce Points and Rewards, you can see that in [this page](http://plugins.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-points-and-rewards). Browse it and try all options available so that you can see how your plugin looks like.

= What are the main changes in plugin translation? =
Recently YITH WooCommerce Points and Rewards A has been selected to be included in the "translate.wordpress.org" translate programme.
In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'yit' to 'yith-woocommerce-points-and-rewards'.
Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org.
During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in:

* yith-woocommerce-points-and-rewards-[WORDPRESS LOCALE].po
* yith-woocommerce-points-and-rewards-[WORDPRESS LOCALE].mo
